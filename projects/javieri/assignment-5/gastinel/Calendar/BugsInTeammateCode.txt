In Appt.java
Method name: getStartHour(), line 135
Description: Instead of returning the startHour of the Appt, returns the startMinute. Meaning startHour can be between 0 and 59, making it possible for the Appt to be incorrect and possibly even invalid. 
Was discovered by assertion errors in ApptTest.java, incorrect assertions when checking validity of startHour. 


In CalDay.java
Method name: getDay(), line 147
Description: Instead of returning day of that instance of CalDay, returns the month. Day int can be between 1 and 31, depending on the month, but month can only be between 1 and 12. This causes the getter to return and wrong day of the CalDay and possibly set the date of it to be wrong.
